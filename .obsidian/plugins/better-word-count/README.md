**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** Due to the introduction of the new Live Preview feature, this plugin needed to be almost entirely rewritten. It will be unstable for a while so please report bugs on github.

This plugin is the same as the built-in **Word Count** plugin, except when you select text, it will count the selected word instead of the whole document. I recommend turning off the built-in **Word Count** because this plugin is designed to replace that. This plugin also has the ability to store statistics about your vault.
