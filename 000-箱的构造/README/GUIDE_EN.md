# Getting Started

The following section describes how to install the Obsidian software, download the valut file locally, and import it into Obsidian. You can also refer to [PKMer's Getting Started with Obsidian tutorial](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1fp4y137vg/) for more information on how to download, install and import Obsidian libraries.

## Install Obsidian

1. Click to download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
2. Follow the instructions of the installation package to install Obsidian.

## Download Prerequisite Font (Optional)

Some special fonts are used in this vault. To ensure the best reading experience, it is recommended to install the relevant fonts on your computer first.

Skipping this step will only affect the presentation style of **the text content in the vault** and will NOT change the content of the vault itself. Therefore installing these fonts will not affect the use of the vault.

Suggested prerequisite fonts to be installed:

- Comic Sans MS
- ÊâãÊú≠‰Ωì-ÁÆÄ
- **Êù®‰ªª‰∏úÁ´πÁü≥‰Ωì**
- [LxgwWenKai](https://github.com/lxgw/LxgwWenKai)

## Download This Vault

There are two ways to download this vault:

1. **Latest version**: Contains features that have not yet been officially released. Click the green button `Code` in the upper right corner of GitHub, select `Download ZIP`, and then decompress the downloaded file to a folder.
2. **Release version (Recommended)**: contains the published stable version. Click on 'Releases' in the right sidebar of GitHub, select the latest version, click on the `reverse.zip` file, and download it to your local machine and unzip it into a folder.

## Import This Vault Into Obsidian

After opening Obsidian, click the "**Open Local Vault**" button, and in the system file browser that pops up, select the library folder that you just finished decompressing to import this library into Obsidian.

During the import process, Obsidian will prompt you with a window asking "Whether to trust the repository". Click Trust and turn on all plugins.
